# Bachelor’s Thesis – The “Mozart Effect” on Spatial Reasoning Ability

**Degree:** B.Sc. in Psychology  
**Focus Area:** Cognitive Psychology / Music and Cognition  

## Abstract
This bachelor’s thesis investigates whether listening to Mozart’s *Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448* enhances spatial reasoning ability compared to silence and soft relaxing music. Spatial reasoning performance was measured using Raven’s Progressive Matrices.

## Research Question
Does listening to Mozart (K. 448) improve spatial reasoning performance relative to silence and soft relaxing music?

## Hypothesis
Participants will perform better on spatial reasoning tasks after listening to Mozart’s K. 448 than after silence or soft relaxing music.

## Method Overview
- **Design:** Within-subject (repeated measures), counterbalanced
- **Participants:** 60 undergraduate students (ages approximately 20–25)
- **Conditions:**

  - Soft relaxing piano music
- **Measure:** Raven’s Progressive Matrices (subsets C and D)

## Analysis
- Descriptive statistics
- Paired-samples t-tests
- Independent-samples t-tests for gender comparisons
